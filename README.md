### Technical Requirements

- React
  - React Router - Using client-side routing to create a single page application
  - React Context - Working with global state (save, modify and consume state)
- Typescript
  - Static type checker. It compiles your React code to type-check your code.
- ESLint
  - For linting/static analysis to have nice and clean code
- Responsive app
  - Propper HTML structure and CSS layout skills (no CSS frameworks)

### App requirements

- When the app loads, the TV SHOWS tab should be selected. Clicking on a tab loads the top 10 MOVIES/TV SHOWS depending on the selected tab.
- The search field should be live and react to any change in the input field.
- The search should fire a request on the search endpoint from TMDB and not filter the top 10 results.
- The search is performed only when there are 3 or more characters in the search bar and it should be triggered only 1 second after the user has stopped typing.
- When there are less than 3 characters in the search bar, the content should revert back to the top 10 MOVIES/TV SHOWS.
- Switching between tabs while searching should trigger the search again with the same search term for the selected tab and update the results.
- When the user clicks on a specific MOVIE/TV SHOW, he is taken to the details view.
- The Detailed View of the Movie/TV Show should show the cover image on top and in case of Movies/TV Shows which have a trailer should show the trailer video instead of the cover image. Below the image/trailer some basic information regarding the selected Movie/TV Show should be shown.
- The Back Button should return the user back to where he was and with the same state before clicking to see more information about a Movie/TV Show. (Meaning that the correct tab should be selected and if the user came from search - the search result with the search term should be there).
